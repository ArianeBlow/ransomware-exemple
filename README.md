## How to use : 

Start the program (can be compiled with pyinstaller or started as python script)

Search for documents to encrypt (By default all OpenOffice / Office / Images documents type)



Start a HTTP server that can receive a POST request (to receive the encryption key used to encrypt the datas)

Start encryption and retreive your encryption key 



the decryptor use the same GUI, start the program , put your key in the input and get back your documents



## Overview

The Ransomware Demonstration Software is a powerful tool designed for educational purposes to showcase the inner workings and potential dangers associated with ransomware attacks. It provides users with a controlled environment to simulate and understand the devastating effects of ransomware on computer systems, without causing any actual harm.

## Features

1. **Safe Environment**: The software operates within a secure sandboxed environment, ensuring that all ransomware activities are contained and isolated from the user's actual data and system.

2. **Realistic Simulation**: The ransomware demonstration software accurately replicates the behavior and techniques employed by real-world ransomware. It demonstrates various infection vectors, such as malicious email attachments, drive-by downloads, or infected USB drives.

3. **Payload Customization**: Users can customize the ransomware payload according to their preferences. They can select different encryption algorithms, specify the targeted file extensions, and set the ransom note message to be displayed to the user.

4. **Progressive Demonstration**: The software provides a step-by-step demonstration of the ransomware attack process. Users can witness the initial infection, encryption of files, and the ransom demand, enabling them to grasp the entire lifecycle of a ransomware attack.

5. **Security Awareness**: The software aims to raise awareness about ransomware and the importance of robust cybersecurity practices. It educates users about preventive measures, such as regular data backups, software updates, and exercise caution while interacting with suspicious links or attachments.

6. **Countermeasures**: Alongside the demonstration, the software provides insights into countermeasures and mitigation techniques to combat ransomware attacks. It highlights the significance of reliable antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and network monitoring.
